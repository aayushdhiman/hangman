# hangman
Hangman, made in Java.

Run the DriverHangMan.java file with the other files in the same package. In the frame, enter the letters you guess until either the hangman dies, or you guess the word and win! 

Feel free to edit hangManWords.txt all you want, however, ensure that the first line is the amount of words there are in the file.
